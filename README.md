# Digital audio workstation

A real-time audio processing workstation.  
Max. clock frequency = 293 MHz.  
'top.vhd' is missing, because the original project has been done using Block Design.  
For the entire Vivado project, please contact me.  
For details, look at the comments on the modules (unfortunately, in italian).
